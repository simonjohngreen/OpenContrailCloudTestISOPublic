This tree builds light customised Linux ISOs which are used by the Juniper PS CLOUD/SDN/NFV team mainly for testing deployments 

This image is OpenSource and can be freely shared both internaly and externaly with customers

The ISO image size is currently 0.8 GB

The ISO motd shown below provides details of the resulting ISO image and the tools provided within it 

========Start of motd=========
This is a private build provided by the Juniper PS SDN/NFV team

The VM is built using the latest Arch Linux kernel repos and is specifically designed for Cloud
and high performance testing.

This VM uses no local disks, just one shared ISO file and memory. Making it sutable for fast and
large scale deployments and SDN NFV testing.

Within VMWare the minimum core and memory requirements are fine.

Within OpenStack the smallest tiny flavour is enough and in addition the HD can be removed.

If your Cloud environment is configured for EC2 metadata then parameters such as hostname will be set 5 seconds after boot

Please send enhancement Requests to sgreen@juniper.net

Recent Improvements and overview Follow:

0) Juniper PS Logo on Boot
1) Latest kernel 4.5.1 so decent performance with iperf3 vs. stock Linux distros
2) The boot no longer waits for an enter key to be hit
3) Open VMware Tools are Installed
4) The keyboard boots as uk, you can change it with
        loadkeys [layout]
        Ex: loadkeys be-latin1
5) Network test tools have been added tcpdump,traceroute,tshark(cli based wireshark),iperf3
6) sshd is enabled be default, password is simon123
7) scapy is installed, usefull tool to flood and to build packets
8) Cloud-init collects EC2 config metadata on boot (only started if http://169.254.169.254 responds)
9) Serial enabled so 'virsh console [vm name] works'
10) New packages can be installed via the internet with pacman
        ex: pacman -Syu       (update the database)
        ex: pacman -S emacs   (install emacs)

========End of motd=========

To build the ISO 
	1) build an standard Arch linux VM (see google for this) I'm using archlinux-2016.03.01-dual.iso
	2) install git and clone this repo over to the vm
	3) ./build.sh -v
	4) After around 5 minutes the bootable linux ISO will appear in out/

To rebuild
	1) rm -rf work
	2) rm ./out/*
	3) ./build.sh -v

To modify and make your own images for CLOUD/SDN/NFV testing
	1) The file packages.both contains a list of arch packages to instal into the ISO during the build. 
	2) All packages are fetched from the configured arch repos during the build
	3) The directory aifsroot contains a custom file tree thats copied into the ISO (replacing any existing files)
	4) aifsroot/root/customize_airootfs.sh is a list of custom commands to execute witin the chroot image during the ISO build
	5) There is a daemon installed and started on boot for running post scripts "juniperps.service" it currently runs /usr/bin/juniperps-startup.sh
	6) For more info seach google for arch wiki [??]
